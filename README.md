# Memory Game Project
## How To Play

This is a classic matching memory game. We have 16 cards, the player can open 2 at a time. When a player opens 2 cards, that is called a move. If in the move those 2 cards match, they stay open, if not they close back. The player must use his/her memory to make sure to open all the cards in the fewest moves possible. 15 moves or less gives a star rating of 3. 15 to 20 moves gives a star rating of 2. Beyond 20 moves gives a star rating of 1. The player is also timed so they can see how fast they move.
